# CSCI 3150 - C program optimization {#csci-3150--memory-management-i}

In this tutorial, we are going to learn some optimization methods for C programs, as outlined as follows:

* the performance of programs are measured by cache misses and TLB misses, which can be checked by using _perf_
* difference between sequential access and random access
* some concrete examples showing the optimization tricks are given

Try to play around with them! Hope you can enjoy this lab!
