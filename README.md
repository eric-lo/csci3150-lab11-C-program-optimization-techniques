# CSCI 3150 - C program optimization {#csci-3150--memory-management-i}

In this tutorial, we are going to learn some optimization methods for C programs, as outlined as follows:

* The performance of programs are measured by cache misses and TLB misses, which can be checked by using **perf**

* Some concrete examples showing the optimization tricks are given:

  * Sorting and Hack

  * Loop unrolling

  * Sequential access and random access

Try to play around with them! Hope you can enjoy this lab!
