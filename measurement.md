# Measurement of cache misses and TLB misses {#measurement-of-cache-misses-and-tlb-misses}

This part briefly describes how to measure cache misses and TLB misses:

* use [_perf_](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page) to access the hardware performance counters

**Important Note**:

Please run\_perf\_on department **linux9 **servers. Because VirtualBox can **NOT **support \_perf \_though \_perf \_can be installed on VM successfully.
