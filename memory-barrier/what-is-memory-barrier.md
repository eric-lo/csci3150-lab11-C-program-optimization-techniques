# What is memory barrier? {#shared-memory}

A memory barrier, also known as a _membar_, _memory fence_ or _fence instruction_, is a type of barrier instruction that causes a central processing unit \(CPU\) or compiler to enforce an ordering constraint on memory operations issued before and after the barrier instruction. This typically means that operations issued prior to the barrier are guaranteed to be performed before operations issued after the barrier.
